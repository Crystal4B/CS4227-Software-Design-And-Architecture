## About
Hotel reservation system is a Java project designed to show effective and efficient use of design patterns and architectural patterns. The applications allows users to book and reserve different rooms. The user specifies a check-in and check-out date and the system then checks if a room is available. A room can accommodate multiple guests specified by the user. The system can be used by multiple types of users including a customer and staff members.

## Structure and Design
The hotel reservation system is designed using multiple technolgies/tools. It operates on a client-server design. The following are the technologies/tools used:

| Technology/Tool | Usage                                               | Implemented By                        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Java            | Programming language of choice.                     | -                                     |
| Gradle          | Used to build and test Java packages.               | Marcin Sęk                            |
| GitHub          | Used as version control for project.                | Marcin Sęk                            |
| GitHub Actions  | Used to create CI/CD pipeline.                      | Jordan Marshall & Aleksandr Jakusevs  |
| GraphQL         | Data query and manipulation language for APIs.      | Marcin Sęk                            |
| SQLite          | Used as a datebase to store data.                   | Marcin Sęk                            |
| Jacoco          | Used to generate code coverage reports.             | Jordan Marshall                       |
| CodeCov         | Analyse code coverage reports                       | Jordan Marshall                       |
| SpotBugs        | Static byte code analysis to look for bugs          | Jakub Pažej                           |

We used multiple design and architecture patterns as part of the project. The following are the patterns we used, aswell as who implemented them:

| Pattern             | Implemented By                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Client - Server     | Marcin Sek                        |
| Command             | Marcin Sęk                        |
| Interceptor         | Jakub Pažej                       |
| Abstract Factory    | Jakub Pažej                       |
| Template            | Aleksandr Jakusevs                |
| Visitor             | Aleksandr Jakusevs                |
| Builder             | Jordan Marshall                   |
| State (Not Counted) | Jordan Marshall                   |
| Adapter             | Eoin McDonough                    |
