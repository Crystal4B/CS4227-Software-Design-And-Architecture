## About
Hotel reservation system is a Java project designed to show effective and efficient use of design patterns and architectural patterns. The applications allows users to book and reserve different rooms. The user specifies a check-in and check-out date and the system then checks if a room is available. A room can accommodate multiple guests specified by the user. The system can be used by multiple types of users including a customer and staff members.

## Structure and Design
The hotel reservation system is designed using multiple technolgies/tools. It operates on a client-server design. The following are the technologies/tools used:

| Technology/Tool | Usage                                               | Implemented By                        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Java            | Programming language of choice.                     | -                                     |
| Gradle          | Used to build and test Java packages.               | Marcin Sęk                            |
| GitHub          | Used as version control for project.                | Marcin Sęk                            |
| GitHub Actions  | Used to create CI/CD pipeline.                      | Jordan Marshall & Aleksandr Jakusevs  |
| GraphQL         | Data query and manipulation language for APIs.      | Marcin Sęk                            |
| SQLite          | Used as a datebase to store data.                   | Marcin Sęk                            |
| Jacoco          | Used to generate code coverage reports.             | Jordan Marshall                       |
| CodeCov         | Analyse code coverage reports                       | Jordan Marshall                       |

We used multiple design and architecture patterns as part of the project. The following are the patterns we used, aswell as who implemented them:

| Pattern           | Implemented By                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|

| Builder           | Jordan Marshall                   |
| Template          | Aleksandr Jakusevs                |
| Abstract Factory  | Jakub Pažej                       |
| Plugable Adapter  | Eoin McDonough                    |
| (ADD 6TH PATTERN) | -                                 |
| Interceptor       | Aleksandr Jakusevs & Jakub Pažej  |
